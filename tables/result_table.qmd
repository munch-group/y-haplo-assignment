# Result tables

This is a table of results from a csv file:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-results
#| tbl-cap: "This could be a table listing results of an analysis."

import pandas as pd
pd.read_csv('../results/result_table.csv')
```

Show more tables (these are the same again):

```{python}
